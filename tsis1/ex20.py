x = ["apple", "banana"]
y = ["apple", "banana"]
z = x

print(x is not z)

# returns False because z is the same object as x

print(x is not y)

# returns True because x is not the same object as y, even if they have the same content

print(x != y)

# to demonstrate the difference betweeen "is not" and "!=": this comparison returns False because x is equal to y
